# Project Overview:

This project focuses on using a linear regression model in predicting the price of used cars based on their specifications. This could give a car dealership insight on the specifications with the most effect on cars prices. 

# Data Description:

The data for this project includes the specifications of several cars including their brand, model, price, engine type, mileage, body type, year, registration information and engine volume.

# Results:

The year and the mileage of the car seem to have the most effect on the price of the car. The model has high accuracy except for low price cars. The low price cars are also observed to have negative residuals meaning that the car prices predicted are higher than the actual prices. It seems that there is a missing piece of information that could improve the accuracy of the model.
